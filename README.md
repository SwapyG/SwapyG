ðŸ”§ **Core Competencies:**
- **GPU Programming & Acceleration:** C++, Metal, Core ML, PyTorch
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning:** Diffusion Models, Model Optimization, Data Pipelines
- **Software Engineering:** Python, API Integration, Low-Level Debugging, Memory Management

ðŸ”­ **Featured Project: GPU-Optimized Diffusion Model for Apple Silicon**
- Successfully ported a CUDA-based AI model to run natively on Apple Silicon.
- Engineered and benchmarked a multi-tiered solution using PyTorch MPS, a custom C++ Metal kernel, and a Core ML-accelerated pipeline, achieving a **~2x speedup** with the Apple Neural Engine.
- Diagnosed and resolved critical, low-level memory corruption (`malloc`) and API-bridging bugs.
